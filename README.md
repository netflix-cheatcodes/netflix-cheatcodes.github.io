# Netflix Cheatcodes

Hi, my name is [Derek Nutile](http://dereknutile.com) and I make web stuff.

I first saw the [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) cheat codes on Reddit and the source sauce here: [https://medium.com/@unblock.com/netflix-cheat-codes-the-open-sesame-of-entertainment-7fb0b75a847f#.ml0xm1kx5](https://medium.com/@unblock.com/netflix-cheat-codes-the-open-sesame-of-entertainment-7fb0b75a847f#.ml0xm1kx5).  A student at George Washington University named [Ben Shepard](http://benshep.net/) built a similar category search at [http://netflixcodes.me](http://netflixcodes.me).

I had already built a filter for [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) at [http://fadbus.github.io/](http://fadbus.github.io/), so I stole my own code and made the Netflix Cheatcodes filter you're looking at today.  I added some meta data to help the filter find categories easier.
